# copy-w3.css-Parallax-Template

This website was built for educational purposes only.
The design was taken from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp">W3.CSS Website Templates</a> tutorial. 

Link to the original Demo:

Results: 
1. This is the first time I made a modal for full size images on click. 
   I came up with the solution myself and I am not sure if it is the correct way of doing this. 
2. I couldn't figure out how to align icons to the center in the Contact Section. 
3. I didn't understand how to make a child to have higher z-index than parent element. 
   The position of the later is "fixed" and can't be changed to "relative".
